### What is C Programming Langauge?

The **C programming language** was created by **Dennis Ritchie** in 1972. A low-level procedural language, C is designed to work across platforms and provide access to important features like memory management. C programming builds up the source code for many UNIX operating systems, compilers, video games, and even other computer programming languages like Python. Although it lacks more modern programming features like object-oriented programming, C remains one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages in the world with broad applications in computer science and software engineering.
